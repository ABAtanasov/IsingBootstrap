##Scratch Directory

This is where various output files relevant to the sdpb
computations will be saved. 

Examples are:
* the files partitioning the way that input points 
are distributed for the individual jobs, 
* the `.xml` files generated by `cboot`,
* the `.out` files of `sdpb`, 
* 


These can either be removed manually by `rm scratch/*` 
after the computations have completed or can be left there
for further analysis (e.g. spectrum extraction can be run on the .out files)
